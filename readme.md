# MTA1

This is a very basic MTA app with a standalone approuter and no odata or any destinations are consumed. This is the absolute shell of an MTA.
Throughout the multiple repo's I'll be creating, I'll highlight the differences between them.

This project was created using yo generators:

$> npm install generator-easy-ui5

$> npm i -g yo

$> yo easy-ui5 project

Run these commands in Package.json file to build and deploy the app, this also generates some files, the repo is the final result: (I logged on to my trial CF account as the API endpoint)

What is deployed for a very straight forward MTA: (compare this to the settings in the MTA.yaml file for understanding)
